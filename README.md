Out of date setup - missing Mechanical Rotary Encoder, Pressure Differential Sensor, and 9 g servomotor linear actuator

#### Description:
Built a pneumatic control system for operating a soft pneumatic actuator by programming a mechanical rotary encoder to control a custom built servomotor linear actuator that regulates the pneumatic actuator's exhaust air flow, and using keyboard inputs to switch the states of a solenoid valve connecting the pressure source and the actuator
